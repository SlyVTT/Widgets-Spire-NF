WidgetApplication Class :
    - [OK] in the Logic() method, update the key shortcuts for Desktop selection
    - [OK] in the LogicWithForcedRender() method, update the key shortcuts for Desktop selection
    - [OK] debug the WidgetApplication::Close() call and track what creates a crash of the calculator when closure is asked
    - create a <vector> collection of widgets to register all the Widgets at creation and track their existence all along the runtime
    - use the above <vector> collection of widgets at Close() to delete them all
    - [OK] debug the application at exit

Menus in general :
    - MenuBarWidget / MenuPaneWidget / MenuItemWidget - check if in MenuPaneWidget we need the AddPopupChild at construction to work propertly

ScreenRenderer Class :
    - improve the visuals of the DrawFilledRoundedRectangle method
    - improve the visuals of the DrawRoundedRectangle method

DepthBufferRenderer Class :
    - [OK] correct the buffer to correctly get the value of (R,G,B,A) components and then pick the right WidgetID for SDL version
    - [OK ?] correct the buffer to correctly get the value of (R,G,B,A) components and then pick the right WidgetID for nGC version
    - [No Need] possibly convert it from uint16_t to uint24_t or uint32_t

General :
    - check if memory is properly freed when using images
    - check if memory is properly freed when closing the application with WidgetApplication::Close()
    - check if memory is properly freed while using FontEngine::Close()
    - check if memory is properly freed while using ScreenRendered::Close()
    - check if memory is properly freed while using DepthBufferRenderer::Close()
    - check is themes are correctly supported while using the ThemeEngine methods

Samples :
    - try to recompile the different sample applications for use with the GUI Toolkit NF version
    - check if the Link SDL example is still compatible with the GUI Toolkit NF (Screen handler share may not be possible anymore)

TimeManager Class :
    - [OK] check if the methods are working properly
    - [OK] check if the TimeManager is correcly initialized using the InternalStartTicks() method obtained from Hoffa's nSDL code
    - check if it is possible to use both fast timer, rather than just the first one
    - create some start markers and stop markets for delta time calculation
    - [OK] create a method providing a timestamping string for debugging applications

Evolutions :
    - create a set of function to be able to use the GUI Toolkit NF on a PC with ()SDL ?)
    - create new widgets such as :
            # MultiPagePanes
